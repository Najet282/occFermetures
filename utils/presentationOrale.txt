Oral :

Hello, let me introduce myself : Najet EL BOUBKARI, 37 years old.
Married and mother of three children,
I decided to change job after having workT as a medical secretary in cardiology.
I discoverD the digital professions thanks to the PPNUM pre-qualifying training offerD by Adrar.
I was seduced by the development option.
So I started the adventure by following the training of mobïle java android web developer. 
And here I am today in front of you to present my project 
which consists in developing a mobïle application for a company Occ'Fermetures, 
client of the communication agency where I did my internship. 
The rest in French, it's better for everyone!
